### The ‘auctions with budget constraints’ problem. 
In this auction, k different items are sold to n different bidders. Each bidder i has a bid b<sub>ij</sub> for item j. Additionally, each bidder i has a budget limit d<sub>i</sub>. If a bidder is allocated items whose combined cost exceeds his budget limit, he pays his budget limit. 
The objective is to find an allocation of the items that maximizes the seller’s revenue.
